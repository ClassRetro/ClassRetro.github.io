# Class Retro

Welcome to Class Retro, where retro games are brought back to playing status. Stop looking for that additional software, or that driver.


## The Story

Hi there, I'm [@jbmagination](https://github.com/jbmagination). I started Class Retro when I was playing Wishbringer on a Windows laptop. Eventually, I was looking around the files, and saw it was using DOSBox. I noticed that it supported many different operating systems, but, anything besides a Windows download was hardly seen anywhere. So many people were missing out on great games, and I wanted to give them that opportunity. So, I made Class Retro to help people play a variety of games, even if you're not on Windows. 

## Featured Games

### Released
```
Wishbringer: The Magick Stone of Dreams (DOS, 1985)
```

### Planned
```
None
```

## Why Class Retro?

### 1. We support more systems
Class Retro doesn't require Windows like most retro game sites do. With Class Retro, you can play it on almost any operating system.

### 2. We're open
Class Retro's transparent, so you can easily make changes, add games, etc.

### 3. We supply
Does the game ask for a manual? You got it. Maybe something you need to read? It's right there. We look for as much information as we can, and grab as much as we can, to give you, the consumer, what you need, so you can use it at the right time.

### 4. Game support
We try to supply support for as many games as we can, without modifying the game itself.
