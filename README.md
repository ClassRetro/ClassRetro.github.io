# Class Retro

Welcome to Class Retro, where retro games are brought back to playing status.


## The Story

Hi there, I'm [@jbmagination](https://github.com/jbmagination). I started Class Retro when I was playing Wishbringer on a Windows laptop. Eventually, I was looking around the files, and saw it was using DOSBox. I was thinking, "Sweet! Let's check them out." I did, and it was supporting TONS of systems! But, all the downloads I found were exclusive to Windows. So many people were missing out on great games, and I wanted to give them that opportunity. So, I made Class Retro to help people play very old games, even if you're not on Windows. 

## Featured Games

### Released
```

```

None
```

## Why Class Retro?

### 1. We support more systems
Class Retro doesn't require Windows like most retro game sites do. With Class Retro, you can play it on OS X, or Ubuntu, or almost anything, really, depending on the emulator.

### 2. We're open
Class Retro's transparent, so you can easily make changes. You can also request games to add.

### 3. We supply
Does the game ask for a manual? You got it. Maybe something you need to read? It's right there. Map? Yep. We look for as much information as we can, and grab as much as we can, to give you, the consumer, what you need, so you can use it at the right time.

### 4. Game support
We try to supply support for as many games as we can. No, we don't change the games themselves, but but we try helping you run and set up the game the way you want it.

### Stop the hassle. Stop looking for that additional software,
or that driver. It all starts here at Class Retro.
